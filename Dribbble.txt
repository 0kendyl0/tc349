adrian_dribbble.jpg: I really like the composition of this shot. The perspective of someone wearing shoes and looking down at them is genius for a shoe ad instead of purely looking at someone else wearing shoes. The colors are soft and appealing. Also, the font is aesthetically appealing and classic.  Faridz Ayish

dribbble-2.jpg: This image appeals to me on many levels. I like the period dress of the men, as it reminds me of a Jane Austen novel--who is my favorite author. Also, I enjoy infographics and these men resemble that type of illustration.   Ariel Tyndell

invino2_db.jpg: This is just a very classy and appealing advertisement for wine. The traditional style of a type of crest is incredibly stylish and appeals to any generation. The wine stain on top of the image is clever because it seems like someone was drinking the wine, placed the cup on top of the image, and drips gathered around the base of the glass. All in all, I find this really clever.   Edwin Servaas
